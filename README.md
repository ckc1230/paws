## Description

<b>paws</b> is a website designed for users whoa are looking to either adopt a new pet or put their pet up for adoption.

The user is able to search for a pet by name or by type (dog, cat, other). If the user wishes to request additional information or express interest in adoption, he or she can click on the owner's name to send an email.

On the other hand, if a user wishes to list his or her pet for adoption, he or she may simply click the "add a pet" button. This will navigate the user to a form where he or she can enter the information required to add the furry friend into our <b>paws</b> database.
