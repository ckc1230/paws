## Description

We are developing a website to serve users who are looking to either adopt a pet or put their pet up for adoption.

The website allows those looking to adopt a pet to browse our animals' names, type, age, location and health. If he or she wishes to request additional information, or desire to adopt an animal, contact information for the current owner is provided.

If one wishes to post a pet for adoption, there is a form that lists out the required information in order to add the furry friend into our Pick-A-Pet database.
